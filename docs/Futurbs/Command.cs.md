### Command
Command is an object holding two public strings, `Name`, and `SecondWord`.

---

### Name
Name is the main command, as found in `CommandWords.cs`.
Refer to `CommandWords.cs.md` for a list of valid commands.

### SecondWord
Not yet implemented; SecondWord allows to give a command extra context, e.g. `"take apple"`.
